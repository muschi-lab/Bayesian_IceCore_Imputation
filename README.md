# Filling data gaps in ice core CFA datasets
This script performs MCMC on Continuous Flow Analysis (CFA) data from ice cores that contain gaps to fill missing data with simulated measurements that retain the same spectral characteristics as the observations. The code was written around the methane data from the Skytrain ice cores presented in: King, A.C.F., Bauska, T.K., Brook, E.J. et al. Reconciling ice core CO2 and land-use change following New World-Old World contact. Nat Commun 15, 1735 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45894-9. 

The code deploys a Bayesian model that simulates continuous methane data that can be used to fill in short gaps in CFA records. The simulated data retains the same 1. autoregressive (AR) coefficients as the observed CFA measurements, 2. moving average as the observed CFA measurements, and 3. values as the discrete CFA measurements, where such observations are available.
